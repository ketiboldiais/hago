# Exponential Growth Functions

Exponential growth functions are functions of the form:

<Maths val={`f(x) = A \\cdot r^{kx}`} block={true} />

Where 𝐴 is an initial value, 𝑟 is a common ratio greater than 1, and 𝑘 is the constant at which the frequency of the common ratio is applied. For example:

<Plot data={[{ f: (x) => 2 ** x }]} />
