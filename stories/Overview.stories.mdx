# Overview

Below is a brief summary of Hago, presented in a Socratic format.

## What is Hago?

Hago is a React component library for generating mathematics and computer science diagrams. The diagrams Hago can generate:

1. Function plots
   - Single-variable function plots in Cartesian coordinates
   - Single-variable function plots in Polar coordinates
   - Multivariable function plots
   - Parametric function plots
2. Trees
   - ùëõ-ary trees
   - Binary trees
   - AVL trees
   - MWay trees
3. Graphs
   - Simple graphs
   - Multigraphs
   - Digraphs
   - Bipartite graphs
4. Various data structures:
   - Linked lists
   - Doubly-linked lists
   - Circularly-linked lists
   - Arrays
   - Matrices
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Circular queues
5. Basic charts:
   - Bar plots
   - Line plots
   - Scatter plots
   - Bubble packs
   - Heat maps
   - Tree maps

## Why is it called "Hago?"

The name Hago is an homage to _Hagoromo chalk_, a historic chalk brand once common in mathematics classrooms and hoarded by professors. The company that produced the chalk, Hagoromo Bungu, closed in 2015 after over four decades aiding mathematicians diagram on blackboards. Despite its closing, the company's legacy and reputation in the mathematics community demonstrates the age-old adage: _A picture is worth a thousand words._
