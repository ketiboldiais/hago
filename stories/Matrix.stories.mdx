# Matrices

Matrices can be rendered with the `<Matrix/>` component:

<Matrix />

## Column- vs. Row-major Ordering

The `<Matrix/>` component provides a property called `order`, which takes one of two values: `row` or `col`. By default, this value is set to `row`, and the matrix will be rendered in row-major order:

<Matrix />

Alternatively, the property can be set to `col`, in which case the matrix will be rendered in column-major order:

<Matrix order={'col'} />

Note: Hago inherently uses typed arrays in row-major ordering for efficiency. As such, using the `col` option will more than likely cause cache misses. For small matrices like the examples above, the misses are negligible, but they can be substantial for larger renderings. A faster approach would be to pre-write the column-major ordered matrix in row-major order representation before passing the data.
